# Management-Tools-
This is a repository of python codes I generally use in my daily project management tasks. 

# **1) Random Name Picker**
This Python program allows the user to randomly select a specified number of names from a text file. The names in the file should be separated by semicolons ";"

After reading the file, the program prompts the user to enter how many names they want to randomly choose, and then displays the selected names. 
# *How to use it?*
First, prepare a text file --> Create a ".txt" file containing names separated by semicolons. 

For example: 
Ali; Sami; Taieb; Rico; Sana; Leo; Julia; Taha; Jalila; Amarjeet; Joe

Second, run the script --> Execute the Python script using a terminal or an IDE

Third, when prompted, enter the full path to your text file containing the names. The program will then ask you how many names you would like to randomly select. Enter the number in integers like "4" and not "four" 

Fourth, enjoy the output!! The randomly selected names will be displayed on the screen.
