# Management-Tools-
This is a repository of python codes I generally use in my daily project management tasks. 

# **1) Random Name Picker**
This Python program allows the user to randomly select a specified number of names from a text file. The names in the file should be separated by semicolons ";"

After reading the file, the program prompts the user to enter how many names they want to randomly choose, and then displays the selected names. 
# *How to use it?*
First, prepare a text file --> Create a ".txt" file containing names separated by semicolons. 

For example: 
Ali; Sami; Taieb; Rico; Sana; Leo; Julia; Taha; Jalila; Amarjeet; Joe

Second, run the script --> Execute the Python script using a terminal or an IDE

Third, when prompted, enter the full path to your text file containing the names. The program will then ask you how many names you would like to randomly select. Enter the number in integers like "4" and not "four" 

Fourth, enjoy the output!! The randomly selected names will be displayed on the screen. 

# **2) Email Finder**
This program helps search for email addresses stored in a ".txt" file. The file should contain multiple emails separated by semicolons ";"

By entering a keyword (like a person's name or domain), users can quickly find a display all email addresses that include that keyword, which makes it simple and effective contact lookup tool. 
# *How to use it?*
First, prepare a database file --> Create a ".txt" file with emails separated by semicolons such as the following example: 

taieb@example.com; taha@domain.com; maria_oxf@maths.com; richard_feynmann@princeton.edu

Second, run the script by executing the code in a terminal or using an IDE

Third, enter the file path to your database text file

Fourth, search for a name or keyword. Type part of a name (e.g., taieb) to find all matching emails. 

Fifth, enjoy the output. The program will display each email that contains the keyword you entered.
